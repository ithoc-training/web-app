## Implementation
Use `keycloak-js` to integrate Keycloak library to React. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycloak-js.

To view user information in a React application using the keycloak-js library, you typically interact with the Keycloak 
instance to retrieve the user's profile after successful authentication.

### Step 1: Ensure User is Authenticated
Before attempting to fetch user information, ensure that the user is authenticated. You can check the authentication status using the authenticated property of the Keycloak instance.

### Step 2: Use the `loadUserProfile` Method
After confirming that the user is authenticated, you can call the loadUserProfile method provided by the Keycloak instance. This method is asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves with the user's profile information.

### Example
1. Configuration: `src/keycloak-config.js`
2. Integration: `src/index.tsx`
3. Login: `src/login.tsx`
4. Profile: `src/profile.tsx`

## Testing
1. Create a user in your Keycloak realm.
2. Start the app by `npm start`
3. Browse to the application: `http://localhost:3000`
4. Login with your username and password.
